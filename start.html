      <p>
        If you’re here, you’re probably dealing with something that feels unfamiliar, high-stakes, and oddly disorienting.
        Not just emotionally—procedurally. New words. New timelines. New rules. People talking past each other.
        And the consequences don’t wait for you to catch up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sharpe System exists because I went through that world myself. I learned—often the hard way—how easy it is to lose
        time, miss leverage, and get dragged into false urgency when you don’t have a map.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is an attempt to give ordinary people a real edge: a fighting chance to orient quickly, think clearly,
        and move forward deliberately in a system that is confusing by default.
