<h1>Start Here</h1>

<p>
Sharpe System is designed for moments when you know
<em>something important is happening</em>,
but you’re not sure where you are in the process or what actually matters next.
</p>

<p>
This system does not give advice.
It helps you orient.
</p>

<h2>What you can do right now</h2>

<ul>
<li>Understand what stage you are in</li>
<li>See common paths forward</li>
<li>Identify dead ends and false urgency</li>
<li>Decide what can safely wait</li>
</ul>

<p>
Decision trees are being built.
