We are continuing work on SharpeSystem.

Current state:
- Static site hosted via GitHub Pages
- All user-facing pages now share the same dark “Risk Awareness” visual style
- Global navigation is loaded via /partials/header.html
- styles.css is now correct and applied across all pages
- Pages use relative links (no leading slash) for GitHub Pages compatibility

Project intent:
- This is decision support and procedural orientation, NOT legal advice
- Tone: calm, neutral, non-reassuring, non-strategic
- Explicit boundaries and disclaimers matter
- No cheerleading, no “you’ll be fine” language

Current focus:
- Building a proof-of-concept “For Attorneys” / Attorney Invite path
- This is NOT authentication yet
- This is informational + workflow preview only

Working rules:
- One task at a time
- Give copy/paste-ready blocks only
- Clearly state WHERE each block goes
- If unsure, default to “replace entire file” or “replace entire section”

Assume:
- I am not a professional developer
- I want things to work, not be clever
- If something breaks, explain WHY in plain language
