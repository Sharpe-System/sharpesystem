# SharpeSystem — Context Snapshot (Update Often)

## What is done
- Global /styles.css updated to match Risk aesthetic
- Header partial wired across pages
- Risk Awareness page live + navigates correctly

## Known issues / bugs
- [list any current issues]

## Next tasks (1–3)
1) Build /triage.html in Risk aesthetic with structured outputs
2) Add portal entry point (“Request access” placeholder)
3) Create /portal/ skeleton pages

## Decisions locked
- One global stylesheet
- Shared header via /partials/header.html
- Risk aesthetic = baseline style
