      <h1>Domestic Violence Restraining Order — Starting Point</h1>
      <p>When safety and stability have been disrupted by someone close, the court can issue a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO) to create clear legal distance and enforceable boundaries. This process often begins during already overwhelming circumstances. The goal here is quiet structure: what the court needs, in what order, without guesswork.</p>
      <p class="muted">This section prepares information for Orange County family court DVRO forms and procedure. It does not determine outcomes and does not replace court instructions.</p>
